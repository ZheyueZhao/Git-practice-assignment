This article is about scientists utilizing machine learning to recognize chimpanzee faces. What I find interesting about this is that Machine learning is starting to mature and starting to increase productivity in the society. The article mentioned the software in question has the "ability to closely monitor different species and populations". While this maybe impressive in research, I wonder whether the same software can be used to monitor humans.

A concorn of me regarding to machine learning is that people may be tracked and monitored with a face recognition system like the one mentioned in the article.
